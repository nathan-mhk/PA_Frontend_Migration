# Plugin Examples

Three example plugins :

1. Traffic Heat map - `./Traffic`

2. Traffic route - `./TrafficRoute`

3. People count and air quality - `./RoomInfo`

You can find tutorial on how the build these plugins here [https://pathadvisor.ust.hk/docs/pluginTutorial/site/](https://pathadvisor.ust.hk/docs/pluginTutorial/site/).

If you just want to  try them quickly, you can choose any numbers of plugins above, move the plugin folders to `<project root>/src/plugins` and in `<project root>/src/plugins/index.js`, import the plugins, run `npx bolt` to install dependencies for the first time then `npm start` the start the app with example plugins.
